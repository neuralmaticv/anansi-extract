**Anansi 1.0-a** (`anansi-extract`) is a Python-based tool for extracting quiz content from video recordings of popular TV game shows, with an initial focus on broadcasts in the Balkan region.

This repository is a fork of the original **[Anansi](https://github.com/ilic5000/pabkvizgenerator)** project by *Nenad Iliƒá*, and aims to enhance **modularity** and **accuracy**, with potential gains in **processing performance** as development progresses. It serves as a foundation for continued development, including broader support for additional quiz formats and potential expansion to English-language content.

The system leverages **computer vision** (OpenCV and FFmpeg) and **optical character recognition (OCR)** technologies (EasyOCR and Tesseract) to detect, extract, and structure quiz questions and correct answers directly from video frames.

Anansi 1.0-a is intended for **educational and research purposes**, offering a flexible framework for parsing structured trivia content from unstructured media.

## Quick Start

## üï∏Ô∏è Why "Anansi"?

The name is inspired by *[Anansi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anansi)*, the clever spider from West African folklore known for his wit, storytelling, and cunning ability to outsmart others. Like its namesake, this tool "crawls" through video data to uncover hidden knowledge ‚Äî in this case, quiz questions and answers.
