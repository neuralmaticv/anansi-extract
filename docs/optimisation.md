# Optimisation Ideas

## Current Optimisation Ideas

1. **Slagalica Processing**
   - If not all 10 questions are found, rollback to the start of the game and process again with lower processing fps
   - This would help catch questions that might be missed due to fast frame transitions

2. **Contour/Shape Recognition**
   - Implement smart thresholds for contour detection
   - Requires extensive testing to find optimal settings
   - Could improve accuracy of rectangle detection
