EasyOCR should automatically download all the required models.  
However, if the automatic download fails (e.g. due to an SSL error), you can download the models manually from [this directory](#) and place them in the appropriate location.

**Note**: Be sure to **unpack all of the model files**, including `craft_mlt_25k.zip`, which is particularly important for accurate text detection.
